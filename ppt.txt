For the deployment of our model we have prefered the
pythons framework flask . Having finished our with
model we saved our model as a .h5 extension file and imported it
on our backend.
From the frontend when we upload a file of .set format 
on which we would like to predict , our backend
first cleans up our file to remove all the artifacts and the bad
channels from the raw EEG and converts it into a dataframe which
contains the time series data , which is further converted to
frequency band data by applying fft . The spacial images are
formed which are in turn fed into our model and the prediction
is made using the model which would then be displayed on the screen
along with some remedies and do's and dont's which would be
recommended .
